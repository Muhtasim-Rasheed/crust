The event functions are used to handle events in the project. They can be used to respond to user input, collisions, and other events. Here is a list of all the event functions in Crust:

- `key_down(key)`: Returns `true` if the specified key is currently pressed down.
- `key_pressed(key)`: Returns `true` if the specified key was pressed down in the current frame.
- `key_released(key)`: Returns `true` if the specified key was released in the current frame.
- `did_get_clicked()`: Returns `true` if the sprite was clicked in the current frame.
- `is_backdrop(backdrop)`: Returns `true` if the current backdrop is the specified backdrop. The backdrop is specified by its index in the stage's backdrop list, starting from 0.
- `is_broadcasted(broadcast)`: Returns `true` if the specified broadcast message was received in the current frame. The broadcast message is specified by its name.
- `broadcast(broadcast)`: Broadcasts the specified message to all sprites. The broadcast message is specified by its name.

!!! note
    If the reciver sprite is placed before the sender sprite in the `project.toml` file, the receiver will not receive the broadcast message. This is because Crust processes sprites in the order they are defined in the `project.toml` file. To ensure that all sprites can receive broadcast messages, place the sender sprite before all receiver sprites in the `project.toml` file.
